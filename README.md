## About
This is a project which would help me to get a portfolio-worthy project. It is a site which has lots and lots of games to play(for now, it has just three) as a means of de-stressing, relaxation or just for fun.

This project gave me a better idea of how the DOM works, accessing, manipulating, styling and updating HTML elements with the DOM. I also affected the control flow using conditionals.

Building this project also brought me much joy as I completed major parts of it **without following a tutorial!**😀

## Tutorials

### Guess The Number

#### ***How-To-Play--Guess-the-number***
 When the game loads, a random number is selected by the computer.
 
 For each respective level, you have a specific number of guesses. Once you exhaust it, it's game over.
 
 Enter a number within the specified range and click on the "Guess" button to make a guess.
 
 Depending on your guess, you will be told if you need to guess higher, guess lower or if you got the number right.
 
 If you got the number right, click on next to generate another number.
 
#### ***Hints--Guess-the-number***

 **BH(Basic Hints):** This gives hints to get the number based on basic math knowlegde like division and multiplication.
 
 **RH(Rhyme Hints):** This gives hints to get the number by showing you words that rhyme with the required number.
 
 **Solve:** As the name implies, this solves the questions for you by entering the required number in the input field. All you have to do is click "Guess".

### Sudoku

#### ***How-To-Play--Sudoku***
When the game loads, all you have to do is click on your desired number, which will be located by the right hand side of the sudoku board on large screens and below it for smaller devices.

After that, you would need to click on an empty box to add the number (if it is allowed there)

The counter above indicates how many tries you have used up - The lower the nuber, the better.

#### ***Hints--Sudoku***

There is no in-game hint yet however, only one number of its value can be on a row/column. So, If you have the number '5' on a row, it cannot be used on the column containing it and vice versa.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors

#### ***How-To-Play--Rock-Paper-Scissors***

I believe we all know the classic game of rock paper scissors. There are just four rules;

1. Rock beats scissors
2. Scissors beats paper
3. Paper beats rock
4. If you and the computer get the same thing, it's a tie

There are 3 levels, round of 3, 5 and 10. this means that for whatever level you pick, you have till either you or the computer get to hat number for the game to end. So, for round of 3, you have till either you or the computer gets 3 points before the game ends. So, yeah.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

#### ***How-To-Play--Tic-Tac-Toe***

This is your basic tic-tac-toe game where a streak of either 3 X's or O's placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally is the winner.
There are two ways to play, but only one is avaiable for now and that is the two player option.
Once the page loads, the player who should start would be indicated just below the tic-tac-toe board.

### Would Yu Rather?

#### ***How-To-Play--Would-You-Rather?***
When the page loads, an api call is made to retrieve a question to ask your friends and clicking on the button after the page loads repeats the sme action and brings out a new question. 

This is great for a large as well as small group of people.
